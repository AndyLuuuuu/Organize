    * Images
    * Videos
    * Audio
    * Compressed
    * Disc Images (For ISO, dmg...etc)
    * Executables
    * Text Files

## How to use:

    1. Run script.
    2. Enter the FULL PATH to the directory you wish to organize.
    3. Press "y" or "Y" when asked to confirm.
    4. Wait...
    5. Your files should now be organized into subfolders.

**Any files that aren't in the current list of file extensions are left alone.**
**Directories are also left alone.**
